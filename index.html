                  A key achievement in my career was the creation of a customized Microsoft environment, integrating MECM, Active Directory, 
                  SQL servers, Microsoft 365, Intune, and Azure AD, all linked to my domain, www.doyenkaba.com. 
                  This project highlighted my expertise in user and device management via MS Intune and SCCM, as well as my ability to deploy packages and task sequences.
                  Most of my projects involved setting up at least two domain controllers with Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, and DHCP features installed and configured. 
                  Additionally, I set up an SCCM server, an SQL server, and another server with WDS and WSUS features. 
                  I also installed Entra ID Connect and Intune Connector to synchronize ADDS with a Microsoft 365 tenant.

                        I began by downloading an HTML and CSS template from GitHub, which provided a solid foundation for my project. To customize the template, 
                        I followed a step-by-step YouTube tutorial that guided me through the process of modifying the code to fit my personal style and preferences.

                        <p>Throughout this process, I gained a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS code structure, including how to manipulate various elements such as headers, footers, and sections.
